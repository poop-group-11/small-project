I WILL UPDATE THIS TERRIBLY DESIGNED README

To run locally:

    clone repository to local folder
    (to install dependencies)
    in root folder: run 'npm i -g create-react-app'
    in client folder: run 'npm i -S axios'
    in server folder: run 'npm i -S mongoose express body-parser morgan'

    (start server)
    in server folder: run 'node server.js'

    (start local development server)
    in a seperate terminal so as not to stop the server from running:
    in client folder: run 'npm start'
    if you get an error and server doesn't start, try running 'npm i -g npm'
    then try starting it again
    if it STILL doesn't work, try running 'npm install' (could take a while)
    then try starting it again
    should open up in your browser automatically at localhost:3000
